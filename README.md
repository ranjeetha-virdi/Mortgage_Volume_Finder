# Mortgage_Volume_Finder
The Goal of the Project is to get the total mortgage financing volume in Germany published by the German Central Bank (Bundesbank).

The first goal of the project is to retreive data for total volume of financing available from the Bundesbank API located at https://www.bundesbank.de/dynamic/action/de/statistiken/zeitreihendatenbanken/zeitreihen-datenbank/759778/759778?listId=www_szista_ph3_neu

The Program should be able to automatically retrieve data at a pre-defined time with help of a cron job.

Analyze the data for StartUp FinTech_Bros and find their market share.
