# Mortgage_Volume_Finder
The objective of this project is to obtain the total residential mortgage financing volume in Germany, as published by the Deutsche Bundesbank, and compare it against our client's mortgage portfolio in order to determine their market share within the German mortgage market.

We retreive mortgage data for total volume of financing available from the Bundesbank API located at https://www.bundesbank.de/dynamic/action/de/statistiken/zeitreihendatenbanken/zeitreihen-datenbank/759778/759778?listId=www_szista_ph3_neu

The Program should be able to automatically retrieve data at a pre-defined time with help of a cron job.

Analyze the data for StartUp FinTech_Bros and find their market share.
